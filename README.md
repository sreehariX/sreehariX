## Hi I am sreehari ðŸ‘‹ ##
- I am sophomore in mechanical engineering at IIT Bombay
- I like tech and like building stuff that people use using crazy code
- And I like to be around smart people and cracked devs
- I am huge supporter of bitcoin and web3 and trying to learn it 


## why do i believe in bitcoin and like it ##
- If you think for a second, economy is build by goods and services there is no real value for money it is just something we use as a exchange . So if we trust a third party like government if they dont manage cash well that will cause issues like inflation and more bitcoin solves this issue by keeping a fixed supply
- For example if you are stranded in a island with billions of dollars in swiss bank you dont care about it , all you care on the island is food and basic needs
- So my goal now is I am currently learning bitcoin and i want to be full time open source contributor and be a part of bitcoin ecosystem
